### Instructions

For re-running analyses reported in the paper (figures 3 and 4), you need to perform the following steps:
1. Create a folder on your computer that hereafter is referred to as the "study directory".
2. Download the [data.mat files](https://github.com/annirichter/FADE_Neuropsy/blob/main/data.mat) and place them into the study directory.
3. Download the [Figure_3_4.m analysis script](https://github.com/annirichter/FADE_Neuropsy/blob/main/Figure_3_4.m) and place it into the study directory.
4. Open MATLAB, set your current directory to the study directory and run the script.
